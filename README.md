# CVGen
CVGen is a Curriculum Vitae Generator developed with python

## How to run this project?
In the moment the project is a console application (but I have plans to make it a webservice in the future), to run it you just need to open the src folder in your terminal, and run the following command:

```shell
python main.py
```

Then it will ask you for the needed information.
